Features:

These can be used anywhere on the web including: discord etc...

Reason I've made this:

I've not been able to find the special characters on windows/linux. These all work on windows, i assume as they should. Some may be invisible on some applications, this is not my fault. Please do not put an issue saying it doesn't work as I have 0 control over this.

Terms of Use:

I have fully spent long hours on perfecting this due to me not being able to find it on the internet anywhere execpt on my macbook pro.

Please do not reupload this anywhere, if you do please link this repo above your reupload on a different website etc...

There will be a folder with most used special characters on discord as I've made this specially for that.

trapbotdiscord.

p.s: idc if you steal this, i did not make the special characters. But it would be nice for you to link this repo. thanks <3
